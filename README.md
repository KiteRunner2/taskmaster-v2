# TaskMaster V2
## Professional task organizer to increase your productivity
##
```
TaskMaster V2 is continuation of TaskMaster project that I have built as graduation project of my coding bootcamp at University of Toronto.

Original TaskMaster was built with James (https://github.com/jamescalverley) and Anant (https://github.com/startanant).

TaskMaster V2 is continuation of that project. I am improving it as I progress as developer.

This is open project and all contributions are welcomed.

My intention is to deploy it and offer it for free.
```

Built with React.js, Express, Node.js, socket.io
